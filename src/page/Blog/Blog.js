            <p>
              <strong>When i should use nodejs?</strong> <br />
              When i should use nodejs Node js is primarily used for
              non-blocking, event-driven servers,data-intensive due to its
              single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites
              and back-end API services. Node JS is best suited for
              real-time collaborative drawing or editing applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>When i should use mongodb?</strong> <br />
              When i should use mongodb SQL. NoSQL databases like MongoDB
              are a good choice when your data is document-centric and
              doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database,
              when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are
              rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases

          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              <strong>What is the purpose of jwt?</strong> <br />
              What is the purpose of jwt JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open
              standard used to share security information between two
              parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded
              JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using
              a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be
              altered after the token is issued
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How does it work?</strong> <br />
              how does it work 1.Users will start by authenticating with a
              username and password managed by Auth0. 2.Once authenticated,
              the client will receive a JWT representing an access token.
              3.The client will include the access token in the
              authorization header of every request to a secure endpoint.
              4.The server will validate the access token and determine if
              it has the right permissions, using the information within the
              token.
